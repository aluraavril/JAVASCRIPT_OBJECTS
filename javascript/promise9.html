<!-- We first have an input field asking the user to input a number. 
Create a Promise that rejects if the inputted value is not between 1 and 10 and resolves by printing the string 
“Yes <number inputted> is between 1 and 10” on the DOM. If the user fails three times to give a number between 1 and 10, 
we’ll just print “You already failed three times, so no chances anymore”.  -->
